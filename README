	 The Scientific Graphics Toolkit (SGT) for highly interactive,
	 flexible, and publication quality graphics of scientific data

	     Features include: user settable or automatically scaled
	     axes; sophisticated, automatically self-scaling time
	     axes; labels as movable, customizable objects; automatic
	     generation of legends to explain the data being
	     displayed; and more.


  Dev Branch

     Objectives

	 Reorganizing into a minimized form for evaluation and
	 application purposes

	 Reviewing performance qualities for demanding real time data
	 display

     Requirements

         Once per second update of thousands of domain elements (X for
	 multiple Y) with plenty of CPU remaining for network I/O,
	 data management, and user interaction in a normal user
	 desktop application.

     Road Map

         Would be nice to have AWT (this existing), JOGL and Android
         backends under a common API.  If possible, something like
         this would be the place to do it.
